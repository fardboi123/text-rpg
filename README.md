# Text RPG

A text-based roguelike RPG I'm making with HTML and JavaScript as a beginner project. <br/>
It would work in a way similar to The Oregon Trail, encountering something every time you proceed. <br/>
This premise is likely to change in the future. <br/>
It can also be played on the browser. <br/><br/>
Frankly, I haven't done much of anything yet.
